\chapter{Aim}

In this chapter, we present approaches for attacking machine learning algorithms with adversarial techniques presented in the previous chapter. We discuss that the knowledge of the architecture and weight parameters is sufficient to derive adversarial samples against DNNs. Further discussion goes into black box attacks where the attack has minimal information about the underlying system. The discussion is then closed with how model's knowledge can be transferred between different algorithms/techniques.
